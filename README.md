Run the following commands on the commandline to get it working:

```
git clone https://github.com/learnetto/reactchat.git

cd reactchat

rails db:migrate

bundle && yarn

foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

## Github Authentication

We use Github for authentication. So you will need to [register a new OAuth application on Github](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

Please make sure you set the authorization callback URL correctly. With the default devise and omniauth settings, add `/users/auth/github/callback` to your root URL.

For example, in development, if your app is running on localhost port 3000, then the URL settings will be:

Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`

Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/github/callback`

Once you've set up your Github app, Github will provide you with a Client ID and secret. You need to add these to your app's environment as `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_SECRET`.

For development, the easiest way is to put them in your `~/.bash_profile`, start a new terminal window and restart your Rails server.

## Running test

```bash
cd client && bundle exec rake react_on_rails:locale && yarn run build:test
bundle exec rake
```
